## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [PX to REM conventer](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) -
  It's really helpful to [use rem instead of px](https://uxdesign.cc/why-designers-should-move-from-px-to-rem-and-how-to-do-that-in-figma-c0ea23e07a15) .However, since I'm mostly familiar with pixel sizes, I decide to use a simple converter for rem size.
